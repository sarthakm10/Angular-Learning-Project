## Learning
    1. prefix in angular.json
        "prefix" is used to define the prefix for component selectors
        It is a good practice to use a unique prefix to avoid conflicts with other libraries or components
        In this case, "robot-shop" is used as the prefix for the components in this project
    2. assets in angular.json
        "src/assets" this allows us to use images in the static content
        we can mention more folder here for our use
